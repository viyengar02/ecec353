/* This incredibly useful tool is provided to help you
 *  * analyze your shell's job creation and management.
 *   *
 *    * Don't be afraid to build other simple tools (like this one)
 *     * to help you debug your shell as you develop Project 2.
 *      *
 *       * Compile using:
 *        *   $ gcc -o job_info job_info.c
 *         *
 *          *********************************************************
 *           *
 *            * Example Use Cases:
 *             *
 *              *
 *               * 1. You can use this tool to check if your shell is
 *                *    putting jobs into process groups correctly:
 *                 *
 *                  * $ ./job_info | ./job_info | ./job_info | ./job_info
 *                   * Terminal FG process group: 10648
 *                    * Command    PID    PPID    PGID
 *                     *     1    10648    10533  10648
 *                      *     2    10649    10533  10648
 *                       *     3    10650    10533  10648
 *                        *     4    10651    10533  10648
 *                         * ^C$
 *                          *
 *                           *********************************************************

 *                             * 2. You can check to see that the foreground process
 *                              *    group is being set correctly:
 *                               *
